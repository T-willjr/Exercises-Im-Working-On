#I'm really confused about what I am supposed to do. I know that I have to create a method for noun, verb, adjective, and adverb and have an argument passed through them so I can print the result below. I keep getting an error saying that there are a wrong number of arguments(given 0 expected 1). I'm not sure what I am supposed to pass that I haven't already.
class Madlib

  def noun(n)
    n
  end

  def verb(v)
    v
  end

  def adjective(adj)
    adj
  end

  def adverb(adv)
    adv
  end

  def result
    "Do you #{verb} your #{adjective} #{noun} #{adverb}? That's hilarious!"
  end

end
